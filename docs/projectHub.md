<h1> Projects I've worked on: </h1>

### &#8594; Advent of Code

This is half of the month of [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/). Advent of code is a fun advent calendar where you complete small programming challenges each day. The fun twist is there is two parts to each day, you implement the first half without knowing what the second task will be. Often you have to rewrite your code and having good designs makes it easy to tweak but bad designs make it quite difficult.

I wanted to do the whole month but got distracted with 2020 life.

### &#8594; Raspberry Pi Network Attached Storage

I have a Mac and a Windows computer, and sharing files between the two is a pain. I mostly resort to either flash drives or Google drive. Unfortunately, my upload speed isn't the best making Google Drive not a great option and I keep losing flash drives. So, I got a Raspberry Pi and set up open media vault as a home NAS. It works wonderfully for my uses and I want to expand it to a larger system for computer backups and make it accessible from outside my home.


### &#8594; Study Buddy

This project was a social good class project that is open source on GitHub. I gathered a team of three other members to create this app which helps students track hours studied and add events easily to their calendars. I lead the team as well as worked with the team to solve blockers.

### &#8594; SURLY Database

SURLY (Single User Relational) database was a pair programming project created in Java to the <a href="/assets/pdf/SURLY-Specification.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SURLY specification sheet</a>. We created a heap based database that could be modularly expanded and supported SQL commands at its core.

### &#8594; Sample Transcript System  

This was a small assignment where we were tasked to use Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) to interface a mySQL database. The program was designed as a command line interface application and implemented good modularity and design.

### &#8594; System Utilities: `ls` and `find`

This task was to create and deploy the system utilities ls and find on a virtual machine that did not have them. Both were written in C with tests to prove functionality. Good documentation and long term functionality were a priority.

### &#8594; IPv6 Firewall

The firewall was deployed to a cluster of NetBSD machines where one played the role of a "bad actor". The program ran as a deamon process and would filter all IPv6 packets. If a "bad actor" was detected, it would send the IP address to my peers in the cluster as an asynchronous event.

### &#8594; Micro Kernel

The micro kernel I completed was based on Harry Porter's [BLITZ system](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~harry/Blitz/). It was modified by my professor, Phil Nelson, for our use in our operating systems class ([WWU BLITZ page](https://facultyweb.cs.wwu.edu/~phil/classes/blitz/)). I personally implemented the system calls necessary to run a simple bash shell which can execute scripts, create and delete files, and fork new processes. Additionally, I helped my peers with understanding virtual and physical memory and how to translate between the two properly.
