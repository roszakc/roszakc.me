### Study Buddy

This project was a social good class project that is open source on GitHub. I gathered a team of three other memembers to create this app which helps students track hours studied and add events easily to their calenders. I lead the team as well as worked with the team to solve blockers.

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/roszakc/StudyBuddy)!

### SURLY Database

SURLY (Single User Relational) database was a pair programming project created in Java to the [SURLY specification sheet](./assets/pdf/SURLY-Specification.pdf). We created a heap based database that could be moduarlly expanded and supported SQL commands at its core. 

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/roszakc/ClassProjectCodeExamples/tree/master/DatabaseSURLYProject)!


### Sample Transcript System  

This was a small assignment where we were tasked to use Java Database Connectivity API (JDBC) to interface a mySQL database. The program was designed as a command line interface application and implmeneted good modularity and design. 

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/roszakc/ClassProjectCodeExamples/tree/master/database_programming)!

### System Utilites: `ls` and `find`

This task was to create and deploy the system utilites ls and find on a virtual machine that did not have them. Both were written in C with tests to prove functionality. Good documentation and long term functionality were a priority.

See the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/roszakc/ClassProjectCodeExamples/tree/master/CompSystemsII_SystemUtilites)!

### IPv6 Firewall

The firewall was deployed to a cluster of netBSD machines where one played the role of a "bad actor". The program ran as a deamon process and would filter all IPv6 packets. If a "bad actor" was detected, it would send the ip address to my peers in the cluster as an asynchronous event.
